# Contributing

This repository publishes multiple packages, but it should still feel like one
coherent system. Good contributions improve a package without weakening the
shared contracts that keep the rest of the workspace aligned.

## Start With Placement

Choose the narrowest correct home for every change:

- package runtime behavior belongs in the owning package under `packages/`
- repository-wide automation belongs in `makes/`
- shared tool policy belongs in `configs/`
- checked-in API contracts belong in the repository API contract directory
- repository governance and handbook content belong at the root or in `docs/`

If the same rule would need to be copied into multiple packages, that is a sign
it probably belongs at the repository level instead.

## Working Principles

- prefer one shared fix over many package-local copies
- keep generated outputs under `artifacts/`
- keep names durable and descriptive rather than tied to temporary planning
  language
- write docs for humans first, especially in the root handbook
- preserve compatibility shims only where they still serve a migration purpose

## Local Workflow

1. Read the root handbook entry points in `README.md` and `docs/`.
2. Change the smallest surface that can honestly own the behavior.
3. Run the checks that match the area you touched.
4. Update contracts, docs, or metadata when the change affects shared behavior.
5. Commit in a small, coherent step with a durable message.

## Validation Expectations

Use the generated root help to discover the current command surface:

- `make help`
- `make list`
- `make list-all`

Typical validation flows:

- root docs and governance changes: `make docs-check`
- root workflow or config changes: `make help`, `make list-all`, and any
  relevant package or root targets
- package-scoped changes: `make -C packages/<package> <target>`
- repository package dispatch changes: `make <target> PACKAGE=<package>`

If you touch checked-in API contracts, schemas, or publish flows, verify the
resulting artifacts rather than assuming the repository state stayed
consistent.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits with clear, durable intent.

Good examples:

- `build(repo): centralize pytest configuration`
- `docs(governance): clarify repository security reporting`
- `refactor(ci): replace duplicated package workflow wiring`

Avoid commit messages that depend on temporary project language or internal
iteration labels. Someone reading the history two years later should still know
what changed and why.

## Pull Request Quality Bar

- explain the user-facing or maintainer-facing effect
- call out compatibility impact when behavior or naming changed
- mention any follow-up that still remains open
- keep unrelated edits out of the same change

## When Shared Files Move

If you move or rename root-owned files, update the references that point to
them:

- package metadata and URLs
- workflow paths and automation
- docs links and handbook navigation
- contract or release references

## Getting Help

Open an issue for questions that are not security-sensitive. For security
issues, use the private reporting guidance in `SECURITY.md`.
