# Dependency Direction

The package should keep dependency direction readable: domain intent near the center,
interfaces and infrastructure at the edges.

This is not only an aesthetic preference. Clear dependency direction keeps
refactors cheaper because reviewers can still tell which layers are allowed to
know about which other layers.

This page is a reviewer-facing map of structure and flow. It shortens code reading instead of trying to replace it.

## Directional Reading Order

- domain and model concerns under the core module groups
- application orchestration that composes domain behavior
- interfaces, APIs, and adapters that sit at the boundary

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/agentic_proteins/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/agentic_proteins/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/agentic_proteins/application` for orchestration and replay coordination
- `src/agentic_proteins/verification` for runtime-level validation support
- `src/agentic_proteins/interfaces` for CLI surfaces and manifest loading
- `src/agentic_proteins/api` for HTTP application surfaces

## Concrete Anchors

- `src/agentic_proteins/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/agentic_proteins/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/agentic_proteins/application` for orchestration and replay coordination

## Open This Page When

- you are tracing structure, execution flow, or dependency pressure
- you need to understand how modules fit before refactoring
- you are reviewing design drift rather than one isolated bug

## Decision Rule

Use `Dependency Direction` to decide whether a structural change makes `agentic-proteins` easier or harder to explain in terms of modules, dependency direction, and execution flow. If the change works only because the design becomes harder to read, the safer answer is redesign rather than acceptance.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `agentic-proteins` is organized internally in terms a reviewer can follow
- which modules carry the main execution and dependency story
- where structural drift would show up before it becomes expensive

## Review Focus

- trace the described execution path through the named modules instead of trusting the diagram alone
- look for dependency direction or layering that now contradicts the documented seam
- verify that the structural risks named here still match the current code shape

## Limits

Treat this page as a working structural map and keep it aligned with code and tests.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the review reaches a public or operator-facing seam
- open operations when the concern becomes repeatable runtime behavior
- open quality when you need proof that the documented structure is still protected
