# Package Overview

`bijux-proteomics-knowledge` exists so evidence and claim state remain explicit
and reviewable. Its job is to own evidence bundle semantics, claim lifecycle
logic, contradiction resolution policies, and review packet generation for
cross-package decision support.

If a reader cannot explain this package in one or two sentences after skimming
this page, the package boundary is still too fuzzy and later pages will inherit
that confusion.

Treat the foundation pages for `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` as the package's durable self-description. If the package still feels blurry after this section, the boundary story is not clear enough yet.

## What It Owns

- evidence bundle semantics and trust policy
- claim lifecycle and contradiction resolution behavior
- readiness synthesis and review packet output contracts
- serialization and schema compatibility for knowledge artifacts

## What It Does Not Own

- runtime orchestration policy
- candidate ranking and lab scheduling policy
- repository tooling and release support

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge/src/bijux_proteomics_knowledge` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge/tests` as the package proof surface

## Open This Page When

- you need the package idea before the implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs here or in a neighboring package
- you want the shortest honest explanation of what this package is for

## Decision Rule

Use `Package Overview` to decide whether a change makes `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` easier or harder to defend as one distinct role in the overall system. If the work makes the package broader without making its role clearer, stop and re-check the boundary before treating the change as a local improvement.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- what problem `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` is supposed to own on purpose
- where the package boundary stops, even when nearby code looks tempting
- which neighboring package seams deserve comparison before the boundary is changed

## Review Focus

- compare the stated boundary with the modules, artifacts, and tests that are supposed to uphold it
- check that out-of-scope behavior is not quietly re-entering through convenience paths
- confirm that the package story still matches the real repository layout and neighboring package docs

## Limits

This page can explain the intended boundary of `bijux-proteomics-knowledge`, but it cannot prove that boundary by itself. The real proof still lives in the code, tests, and neighboring package seams that either support or contradict the story told here.
