# Security and Safety

Security review in `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` should focus on the package's real boundary surfaces and outputs.

This page keeps safety work concrete. A useful security discussion starts from
the actual interfaces, artifacts, and authority the package holds, not from
generic caution language detached from the codebase.

These operations pages show how `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` is run and reviewed without forcing readers to reconstruct the workflow from logs or oral history.

## Review Anchors

- CLI entrypoint in src/bijux_proteomics_knowledge/evidence.py
- HTTP app in src/bijux_proteomics_knowledge/claims.py
- knowledge contracts in src/bijux_proteomics_knowledge/schema.py

## Safety Rule

Any change that broadens package authority should update docs, tests, and release notes together.

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge/pyproject.toml` for package metadata
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge/README.md` for local package framing
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-knowledge/tests` for executable operational backstops

## Open This Page When

- you are installing, running, diagnosing, or releasing the package
- you need repeatable operational anchors rather than architectural framing
- you are responding to package behavior in local work, CI, or incident pressure

## Decision Rule

Use `Security and Safety` to decide whether a maintainer can repeat the package workflow from checked-in assets instead of memory. If a step works only because someone already knows the trick, the workflow is not documented clearly enough yet.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- how `bijux-proteomics-knowledge` is installed, run, diagnosed, and released in practice
- which checked-in files and tests anchor the operational story
- where a maintainer should look first when the package behaves differently

## Review Focus

- verify that setup, workflow, and release statements still match package metadata and current commands
- check that operational guidance still points at real diagnostics and validation paths
- confirm that maintainer advice still works under current local and CI expectations

## Limits

Checked-in commands, artifacts, and validation remain the source of truth for this workflow.

## Read Next

- open interfaces when the operational path depends on a specific surface contract
- open quality when the question becomes whether the workflow is sufficiently proven
- move back to architecture when operational complexity suggests a structural problem
