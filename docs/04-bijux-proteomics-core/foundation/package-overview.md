# Package Overview

`bijux-proteomics-core` exists so target programs and decision gates are
described with explicit, stable contracts. Its job is to own domain models for
program intent, target and assay definitions, lifecycle transitions, and
validation rules consumed by intelligence, knowledge, and lab layers.

If a reader cannot explain this package in one or two sentences after skimming
this page, the package boundary is still too fuzzy and later pages will inherit
that confusion.

Treat the foundation pages for `bijux-proteomics-core` as the package's durable self-description. If the package still feels blurry after this section, the boundary story is not clear enough yet.

## What It Owns

- program definitions and lifecycle contracts
- domain validation and identifier consistency rules
- constraints and review-gate model semantics
- runtime adapter boundary for integrating program models

## What It Does Not Own

- runtime orchestration policy
- evidence and assay outcome policy
- repository tooling and release support

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-proteomics-core` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-core/src/bijux_proteomics` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-core/tests` as the package proof surface

## Open This Page When

- you need the package idea before the implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs here or in a neighboring package
- you want the shortest honest explanation of what this package is for

## Decision Rule

Use `Package Overview` to decide whether a change makes `bijux-proteomics-core` easier or harder to defend as one distinct role in the overall system. If the work makes the package broader without making its role clearer, stop and re-check the boundary before treating the change as a local improvement.

## What This Page Answers

- what problem `bijux-proteomics-core` is supposed to own on purpose
- where the package boundary stops, even when nearby code looks tempting
- which neighboring package seams deserve comparison before the boundary is changed

## Reviewer Lens

- compare the stated boundary with the modules, artifacts, and tests that are supposed to uphold it
- check that out-of-scope behavior is not quietly re-entering through convenience paths
- confirm that the package story still matches the real repository layout and neighboring package docs

## Honesty Boundary

This page can explain the intended boundary of `bijux-proteomics-core`, but it cannot prove that boundary by itself. The real proof still lives in the code, tests, and neighboring package seams that either support or contradict the story told here.

## Next Checks

- move to architecture when the question becomes structural rather than boundary-oriented
- move to interfaces when the question becomes contract-facing
- move to quality when the question becomes proof or review sufficiency

## Purpose

This page gives the shortest honest description of what the package is for.

## Stability

Keep it aligned with the real package boundary described by the code and tests.
