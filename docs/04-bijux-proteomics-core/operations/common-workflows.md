# Common Workflows

Common workflows should sound like the real jobs people do with the package, not generic process filler.

## Operating Rules

- review a program or target contract change against lifecycle and execution rules
- check whether runtime consumers need explicit downstream validation
- update contract-facing docs with the same discipline as the code change

## First Proof Check

- `src/bijux_proteomics/program_spec.py` and `targets.py`
- `src/bijux_proteomics/lifecycle.py` and `validation.py`
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-core/tests`
