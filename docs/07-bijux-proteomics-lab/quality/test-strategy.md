# Test Strategy

The tests for `bijux-proteomics-lab` are the executable proof of its package contract.

This page helps readers see the broad proof shape of the package rather
than treating the test tree like a bag of unrelated checks. A good strategy page
explains why these tests exist, not just where they live.

`bijux-proteomics-lab` earns trust through visible proof, and these are the places where skepticism still belongs.

## Test Areas

- tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime
- tests/e2e for governed flow behavior
- tests/regression and tests/smoke for replay and storage protection
- tests/golden for durable example fixtures

## Concrete Anchors

- tests/unit for api, contracts, core, interfaces, model, and runtime
- tests/e2e for governed flow behavior
- README.md

## Open This Page When

- you are reviewing tests, invariants, limitations, or ongoing risks
- you need evidence that the documented contract is actually defended
- you are deciding whether a change is truly done rather than merely implemented

## Decision Rule

Use `Test Strategy` to decide whether `bijux-proteomics-lab` has actually earned trust after a change. If one narrow green check hides a wider contract, risk, or validation gap, the work is not done yet.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- what currently proves the `bijux-proteomics-lab` contract instead of merely describing it
- which risks, limits, and assumptions still need explicit skepticism
- what a reviewer should be able to say before accepting a change as done

## Review Focus

- compare the documented proof story with the actual test layout and release posture
- look for limitations or risks that should have moved with recent behavior changes
- verify that the claimed done-ness standard still reflects real validation practice

## Limits

This page shows how `bijux-proteomics-lab` earns trust today, but prose is not the source of truth. If the listed tests, checks, and review practice stop backing the story, the story has to change.

## Read Next

- open foundation when the risk appears to be boundary confusion rather than missing tests
- open architecture when the proof gap points to structural drift
- open interfaces or operations when the proof question is really about a contract or workflow
