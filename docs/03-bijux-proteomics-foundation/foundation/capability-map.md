# Capability Map

The fastest way to understand `bijux-proteomics-foundation` is to map capabilities to the
code that carries them. This page helps a reader move from a package claim
to a likely code area without pretending that module names alone are enough.

When this page is healthy, the package feels like a set of deliberate abilities,
not a pile of implementation details.

Treat the foundation pages for `bijux-proteomics-foundation` as the package's durable self-description. If the package still feels blurry after this section, the boundary story is not clear enough yet.

## Capability Map

- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/model` for durable runtime models
- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/runtime` for execution engines and lifecycle logic
- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/application` for orchestration and replay coordination
- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/verification` for runtime-level validation support
- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/interfaces` for CLI surfaces and manifest loading
- `src/bijux_proteomics_foundation/api` for HTTP application surfaces

## Produced Artifacts

- execution store records
- replay decision artifacts
- non-determinism policy evaluations

## Concrete Anchors

- `packages/bijux-proteomics-foundation` as the package root
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-foundation/src/bijux_proteomics_foundation` as the import boundary
- `packages/bijux-proteomics-foundation/tests` as the package proof surface

## Open This Page When

- you need the package idea before the implementation detail
- you are deciding whether work belongs here or in a neighboring package
- you want the shortest honest explanation of what this package is for

## Decision Rule

Use `Capability Map` to decide whether a change makes `bijux-proteomics-foundation` easier or harder to defend as one distinct role in the overall system. If the work makes the package broader without making its role clearer, stop and re-check the boundary before treating the change as a local improvement.

## What You Can Resolve Here

- what problem `bijux-proteomics-foundation` is supposed to own on purpose
- where the package boundary stops, even when nearby code looks tempting
- which neighboring package seams deserve comparison before the boundary is changed

## Review Focus

- compare the stated boundary with the modules, artifacts, and tests that are supposed to uphold it
- check that out-of-scope behavior is not quietly re-entering through convenience paths
- confirm that the package story still matches the real repository layout and neighboring package docs

## Limits

Code, tests, and neighboring package seams remain the proof of this boundary.
